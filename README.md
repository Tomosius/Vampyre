## Main Page
- I have chosen Bran Castle as the main picture, as most of people when we thing about vampires, first thing that springs to mind is Dracula, and everyone knows, that he originates from Bran Castle, Transylvania
- Also i have implemented some text over that picture to show how text can be placed above image with some background, that is in different color and semi-transparent, so it is easier to read it.
- Whole website has 2 colors: white color transitions to blood vertically.
- If error accurs on website (it is not loading), it automatically redirectts to 404 page.

## Brief History
- On this page i have created 4 articles each consisting of image and text
- All images are automatically floating to left or right, depending on what article they are (odd or even). This makes in certain way like a boxed style website, that is easy to read. 
- I have used Justify alignment for text

## Contact
- On this page i have created form, where reader (or website visitor) can contact if want to, some fields are required, otherwise it will not be possible to submit form:
    1. First Name - Required
    2. Last Name
    3. Email address - Required
    4. Message - Required. For message field i have used textbox function, so field is bigger for content.
    5. Button - Send Message
- After message is submitted, you will be redirected to another page, where it shows that message was received

## Navigation
- I have created 3 navigation buttons:
    1. Home Page
    2. Brief History
    3. Contact
- All navigation are links to specific website files with hidden decorations and list marks.
- navigation links are presented in black color, but when mouse is above it, they become red color to show that website is responsive.

## Footer
- Footer is located at the bottom of website and i have made its background black, so it stands out
- Footer contains links:
    1. My personal LinkedIn Profile
    2. Source code of this project
    3. About - small description about this project
- Each link has 2 elements:
 1.  Icon
 2.  Link Name
 - Each link will redirect you to specific website (according to link name) and will open in new tab.

## Fonts and colours:
- I have implemented 2 different fonts:
  1. Abbadon - this font is stored locally on server
   2. Didact Gothic - bootstrapped from Google Fonts
- Website is based on few colors:
    1. White
    2. Black
    3. Blood RGB (136, 8, 8)
    4. Whitesmoke - i used this color for text inline with black background
