            <h1>This is my First Portfolio project for Code Institute "Full Stack Development" course</h1><br>
            <h2>What is it about and what i tried to achieve?</h2><br>
            <p>
                On this project i have tried to implement HTML and CSS features that i have learned on this course and implement some other ones i have found on internet. Most fascinating for me were CSS pseudo classes, such as "nth-child", what saved me making separate classes for each article, and i was able to arrange them the way i would like it.</p>
            <p>
                I have arranged articles in very specific way, where i believe it is easier to read, as images separates each article to "boxes" by flowing from left to right side and back. At beginning i had an idea to make images rotate or to manipulate them, when clicking on them, they disappear and reveals text behind them, but had to leave that idea, as i believe it is more tricky to understand what needs to be done on website, thus leaving images float from one side to another, i made it more intuitive to read and understand where article ends.
